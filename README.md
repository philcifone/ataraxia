# ataraxia

# Project scope:

A self hosted personal library catalog. Accessible via web app to easily list, add, edit, and delete books from one's personal collection. 

This is a beginner project I'm developing to solve a personal need. It is a super basic CRUD application. I'm not much of a developer, and I am learning as I go. Thus, if you find this interesting or useful and want to offer feedback I will happily listen!

## Frontend:

HTML and CSS

## Backend:

SQLite & Flask

## Usage & Installation

Anyone is absolutely welcome to use this, as of now I'm still learning and cannot deploy it as any sort of full fledge self hosted application just yet, but if you set up you own databases and reference it as I do you will have a basic CMS application.
